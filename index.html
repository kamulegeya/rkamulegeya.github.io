    <h2>Landlord App — Value Proposition</h2>
    <p>
      The Landlord App is a professional, automation-driven property management platform designed to replace manual spreadsheets
      and fragmented tools. It helps landlords and agencies manage local and multi-country rental portfolios with accuracy,
      minimal manual effort, and compliance-ready financial records.
    </p>

    <h2>Why it is valuable</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Automated billing:</b> invoices can be generated automatically at the start of each billing period based on active tenancies, with review and approval before posting.</li>
      <li><b>Fast payment capture:</b> bulk receipt import (Excel/CSV) supports high-volume collections and reduces reconciliation effort.</li>
      <li><b>Professional tenant communication:</b> invoices, reminders, receipts, statements, PDFs, and SMS can be produced and shared quickly (where supported).</li>
      <li><b>Multi-currency operations:</b> supports multiple currencies across tenancies, invoices, receipts, expenses, and reports, with exchange rate handling where required.</li>
      <li><b>Scales with portfolio growth:</b> designed for large landlords and agencies managing multiple owners, properties, locations, and currencies.</li>
      <li><b>Audit and compliance readiness:</b> preserved history, structured exports, supporting evidence for expenses, and integrity-first workflows support audits and dispute resolution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What the app covers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Tenancy-centric management:</b> tenancies link tenants, units, rent, currency, and billing rules for consistent invoicing and reporting.</li>
      <li><b>Documents:</b> one-click PDF invoices/receipts/demand notes and auto-generated tenancy agreements (Word format), where supported.</li>
      <li><b>Expenses:</b> expense tracking with evidence attachments (photos/PDF/Word), where supported.</li>
      <li><b>Inventory and assets:</b> valuation, assignments, and history to improve handovers and inspections.</li>
      <li><b>Reporting and analytics:</b> dashboards for cashflow, arrears, occupancy, payment behavior and trends, with PDF/Excel/CSV exports.</li>
      <li><b>Export-first design:</b> structured data exports to support accountants, auditors, and regulators.</li>
      <li><b>Rental tax intelligence:</b> country-specific tax profiles (flat, progressive, VAT, withholding, provisional), where configured.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Required setup (in order)</h2>
    <p>
      To start using the app effectively, complete the core setup in this order: add the property owner(s), add properties,
      set up rental units under each property, define tenancy terms (rent amount, billing cycle, deposits, start/end rules),
      add tenants, and then allocate tenants to units to activate tenancy management, billing, receipts, expenses, inventory,
      and reporting.
