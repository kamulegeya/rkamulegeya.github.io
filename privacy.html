  <h2>Section 2: Privacy Policy</h2>

  <!-- UPDATED to reflect opt-in Crashlytics -->
  <p>
    <b>Key point:</b> Your property and tenant records are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded to our own servers.
    Optional crash reporting can be enabled in Settings; if enabled, the App may transmit limited crash diagnostics via Firebase Crashlytics
    to help improve stability and reliability.
  </p>

  <h4>1. Data Collection and Storage</h4>
  <p>
    The App is designed to store your rental property and tenant information locally on your device using a secure SQLite database.
    We do not upload your property and tenant records to our own servers. This does not prevent limited diagnostic data (such as crash reports)
    from being sent to Firebase Crashlytics as described below if you enable crash reporting in Settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    To improve app stability and diagnose unexpected errors, the App can use <b>Firebase Crashlytics</b> (a Google Firebase service)
    to collect and transmit crash diagnostics when the App crashes or encounters a serious error.
    These diagnostics help us identify and fix bugs and improve reliability.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Data Security</h3>
  <p>
    Data is protected by login controls and encryption. Keep your password and device secure.
  </p>

  <!-- UPDATED to match user-enabled setting -->
  <h4>2A. Crash Reporting and Diagnostics (Firebase Crashlytics)</h4>
  <p>
    If you enable crash reporting in the App’s Settings, Firebase Crashlytics automatically collects crash reports and diagnostics to help us
    understand and fix stability issues. Crash reports may include crash traces, device and app metadata (such as OS version, device model,
    and app version), and identifiers like Crashlytics Installation UUIDs and Firebase installation IDs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Crashlytics retains crash-related data for a limited period (for example, around 90 days) before removal processes begin.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App does not intentionally include your tenant names, phone numbers, addresses, or other private records in crash reports.
    However, if such data is included in an error message or log output generated on the device, it may be captured as part of a crash trace.
    We recommend keeping in-app logs and error messages free of personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you disable crash reporting in Settings, the App will not send Crashlytics crash diagnostics from your device.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Backups</h3>
  <p>
    You are responsible for creating backups. The app may offer export options to external storage or cloud services such as Google Drive.
  </p>

  <h4>4. Data Sharing</h4>
  <p>
    We do not sell your data. The App does not share your locally stored property and tenant records with third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you enable crash reporting in Settings, crash diagnostics are shared with Google Firebase (Firebase Crashlytics) for the purpose of
    crash reporting and app stability improvements.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Permissions</h3>
  <p>
    The App may request limited permissions (e.g., storage access) only to support backup/restore.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Subscription Payments</h3>
  <p>
    Payments are processed via Google Play Billing; the App does not store or process card/payment details.
  </p>

  <h3>7. User Rights</h3>
  <p>
    You can delete all app data by clearing the App’s storage or uninstalling it.
  </p>
